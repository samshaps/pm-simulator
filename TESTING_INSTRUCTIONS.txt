PM SIMULATOR - TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

IMPORTANT: Before testing, reseed the database with new events:
```bash
npm run seed
```

✅ COMPLETED CHANGES
====================

1. ✅ Randomized Starting Conditions (±25% variance, balanced totals)
2. ✅ Hidden Impact (removed effort correlation)
3. ✅ Tech Debt CTO Sentiment Cap
4. ✅ Mandatory Ticket Auto-Add & Lock
5. ✅ Emoji/Color Threshold Alignment (70/50/30)
6. ✅ Tech Debt Color Inversion Fix
7. ✅ Ticket Size Distribution (1-2 small, 2-3 medium, 1-2 large)
8. ✅ 41 Total Loading Messages
9. ✅ 35 Random Events (was 20, added 15 new)
10. ✅ 18 CEO Focus Shift Narratives (new)

🧪 QUICK SMOKE TEST (5-10 minutes)
===================================

1. START NEW GAME
   - Verify metrics are randomized (not all the same as last game)
   - Check backlog has mixed ticket sizes

2. SPRINT 1
   - If mandatory ticket appears: verify it's auto-added with 🔒 icon
   - Try to remove mandatory ticket → should show alert
   - Complete sprint → check loading message variety

3. RETRO SCREEN
   - Verify tech debt changes use correct colors:
     * Tech debt INCREASE = red/negative
     * Tech debt DECREASE = green/positive
   - Check that emoji faces align with bar colors

4. CONTINUE PLAYING
   - Play 2-3 more sprints
   - Watch for random events in retro (should see variety)
   - Monitor CTO sentiment when tech debt is high (should cap at 60-75)

🔬 DEEP TESTING (15-20 minutes)
================================

RANDOMIZED START
----------------
✓ Start 3 new games on SAME difficulty
✓ Verify starting metrics are different each time
✓ Check that games don't feel obviously "easier" or "harder"

MANDATORY TICKETS
-----------------
✓ Get sales/CTO/CEO sentiment below 25
✓ Wait for mandatory ticket (roadmap hijack)
✓ Verify ticket is auto-added to sprint
✓ Verify lock icon (🔒) appears on committed ticket
✓ Try to remove it → should get alert
✓ Try starting sprint → should work (no manual check needed)

HIDDEN IMPACT
-------------
✓ Complete 10+ tickets across multiple sprints
✓ Observe that:
   - Small tickets (1-3pts) sometimes have huge impact
   - Large tickets (7-10pts) sometimes fizzle
   - Impact doesn't obviously correlate with effort

TECH DEBT CAP
-------------
✓ Let tech debt climb to 80+
✓ Ship successful infrastructure/tech debt tickets
✓ Verify CTO sentiment CANNOT exceed 60
✓ Reduce tech debt to 65
✓ Verify CTO sentiment CANNOT exceed 75

EMOJI/COLOR ALIGNMENT
---------------------
✓ Get any sentiment to exactly 60
   - Bar should be GRAY
   - Face should be NEUTRAL 😐
✓ Get any sentiment to 70
   - Bar should be GREEN
   - Face should be HAPPY 😊
✓ Get any sentiment to 50
   - Bar should be GRAY
   - Face should be NEUTRAL 😐

TECH DEBT COLORS
----------------
✓ Complete sprint where tech debt INCREASES
   - Retro should show increase in RED
   - Dropdown delta should show as NEGATIVE (red)
✓ Complete sprint where tech debt DECREASES
   - Retro should show decrease in GREEN
   - Dropdown delta should show as POSITIVE (green)

RANDOM EVENTS
-------------
✓ Play through 8-12 sprints
✓ Track random events in retro "Key Insights" section
✓ Verify variety (should NOT see same 3-4 repeatedly)
✓ Verify both positive and negative events appear
✓ Examples to watch for:
   - Positive: "Unexpected BI Support", "Positive G2 Reviews", "Product Hunt Success"
   - Negative: "Cloud Provider Incident", "Budget Cuts", "API Rate Limit Complaints"

CEO FOCUS SHIFTS
----------------
✓ Play through quarterly transitions
✓ Verify CEO focus shift narratives have variety
✓ Should see different messages for same focus type
✓ Examples:
   - Self-serve: "PLG is the only defensible growth engine"
   - Enterprise: "Fortune 500 prospect call"
   - Tech debt: "Production incident during demo"

TICKET SIZE MIX
---------------
✓ Check 5+ sprint planning screens
✓ Count ticket sizes in backlog:
   - Small (1-3pts): Should see 1-2 per sprint
   - Medium (4-6pts): Should see 2-3 per sprint
   - Large (7-10pts): Should see 1-2 per sprint
✓ Verify mix isn't always exact same distribution

🐛 KNOWN ISSUES TO WATCH
=========================

1. Single-point capacity bug (user reported but couldn't reproduce)
   - If you get only 1 point capacity, note the game state

2. CEO focus display mismatch
   - If retro says one focus but planning shows different, report it

📊 TESTING METRICS
==================

PASS CRITERIA:
- Starting conditions vary across 3 games ✓
- Mandatory tickets auto-add and lock ✓
- Tech debt color inversion fixed ✓
- CTO caps work at 60/75 based on debt ✓
- Emoji/colors align at 70/50/30 ✓
- Random events show variety (10+ unique in 12 sprints) ✓
- CEO narratives show variety (5+ unique across quarters) ✓
- Ticket sizes have good mix (verified in 5 sprints) ✓

FAIL CRITERIA:
- Same starting metrics in 2+ games
- Mandatory ticket can be removed
- Tech debt increase shows green
- CTO >60 when debt >75

🚀 MERGE TO MAIN
================

After testing passes, run:
```bash
./merge-to-main.sh
```

The script will:
1. Commit all changes
2. Merge to main
3. Push to origin

Make sure to reseed database in production after deploy:
```bash
npm run seed
```
