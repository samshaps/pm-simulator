PM Simulator — v1 PRD
1. Product Vision
PM Simulator is a single-player strategy game about being evaluated (not about building the best product!).
Players act as a Product Manager at a SaaS company. They choose work for their team to pursue under specific constraints, incomplete information, and shifting priorities. Outcomes are probabilistic and interpretations are subjective. Just like being a real PM!

2. Design Principles
This is fun first and a simulator second.
The game should be fun to play and inspire a feeling of “just one more run.” The second it starts to feel like actual product work is the second we lose the user.
There is a casual relationship between decisions and outcomes.
Outcomes in the game (ticket impact results, QBR, reviews) should feel rational, but by no means guaranteed up front.
Everything is a tradeoff.
There’s no such thing as a free win. Prioritizing one thing means hurting something else.
Don’t lose them in the details.
Players should be able to derive insights and make decisions super fast. Don’t bury them in metrics and descriptions.

3. Game Structure
Time Horizon
One game = one year
One year = four quarters
One quarter = three month-long sprints
Win Condition
Finish the year with a strong performance review (note: on a bell-curve)

Key metrics + trending indicators: 
Metrics
Player-visible metrics include the following:
Team sentiment: Represents morale and willingness to execute. Has an impact on chances of ticket success and available team capacity.
CEO sentiment:  Represents confidence in the PM. Has an impact on performance review ratings. 
Sales sentiment: Represents satisfaction with enterprise delivery. Has an impact on enterprise growth and freedom of choice within the tickets. 
Self-serve growth: Represents user and subscription momentum. 
Enterprise growth: Represents large deals and strategic traction. 
Tech debt: Represents system health and fragility. Has an impact on chances of ticket success and freedom of choice within the tickets.
There are also metrics influencing outcomes that the player cannot see:
NPS: Influenced by UX changes (too many is bad), pricing and monetization efforts, and tech debt levels. Current state of NPS shows up indirectly in product pulses and occasional random events.
Velocity: Derived from team sentiment and tech debt.
All metrics are shown as directional trends, not absolutes. We will display them as relative trend ranges possibly with an arrow for the growth + tech debt metrics and the display of a face for the sentiment metrics with varying degrees of emotion depending on the current level.

9. Stakeholder Archetypes
Team
Factors affecting sentiment
CTO and CEO sentiment
Overbooking sprint team capacity with stretch goals
Tech debt
Sentiment impact
Chance of individual ticket success
Available sprint capacity
Sales
Factors affecting sentiment
Recency of tickets prioritized for enterprise needs
Sentiment impact
Positive trend fuels enterprise growth
Negative trend hurts enterprise growth and increases likelihood of roadmap hijack
CTO
Factors affecting sentiment
Tech debt
Sentiment impact
Positive trends may lend additional resources in the form of temporary extra engineering help (Office of the CTO)
Negative trends increase likelihood of tech deb specific roadmap hijacks
CEO
Factor affecting sentiment
The CEO has one active priority focus. This focus shifts more or less quarterly. However, random events can immediately shift the focus. The focus can be one of the following: 
Self-Serve Growth
Enterprise Growth
Tech debt
Random events that shift the focus include things like conference attendance, board meetings, “scrolling through LinkedIn and read something interesting”
Sentiment impact
Sentiment toward the PM throughout the quarter has a weight on review outcome.
Tickets aligned with current CEO focus:
Higher likelihood of success
Larger sentiment upside
Misaligned tickets:
Reduced upside
Higher downside sensitivity

v1 is successful if players:
Debate whether a decision was “actually right”


Feel outcomes were defensible but frustrating


Replay to see how interpretation changes


Say “this feels uncomfortably accurate”
